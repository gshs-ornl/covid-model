# covid-model

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An initial repo to test spatio-temporal modeling of covid-19.


## Example Data
There are two files under `data/` relating to Washington state

- `washington-acs.RData`: data.frame including `sf` geometries. Contains example variables from ACS as well as county membership of MSAs
- `washington-covid19.csv`: csv of daily county level covid19 cases and deaths.

Both of these files can be recreated with the scripts in `data-raw/`
